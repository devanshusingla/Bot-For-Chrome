# Chrome Bot

It is a chrome extension to provide interface of bot which can perform some tasks through commands. You can even add your commands and if it works we would be happy to include it :stuck_out_tongue:. You can start by seeing the **accessFeatures.js** present in **extension > scripts > front > accessFeatures.js**.

You can also drag the bot by clicking on it and may play with it even ( try dragging ).
